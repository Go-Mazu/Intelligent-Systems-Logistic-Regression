# Intelligent-Systems-Logistic-Regression

The objective was to develop an understanding of logistic regression and mini batch logistic regression by hand-coding the processes to better understand their function. The batch vs minibatch results were compared, and the minibatch typically performed with greater accuracy. The scikit functions proved to be more effective than the hand-made processes, however an advantage of the hand processes is the ability to plot error/cost per iteration charts.
